# Iris-Flower-Prediction

Iris Flower Classification Using Logistic Regression (Multiclassification)
The Iris flower dataset is a classic example in machine learning, involving the classification of Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Logistic Regression for multiclass classification is an effective and interpretable method for solving this problem. This mini-project is a part of my Machine learning journey to help me understand the basics and implement my knowledge at the same time.
